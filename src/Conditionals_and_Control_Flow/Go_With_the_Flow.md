## Go With the Flow
Just like in real life, sometimes we'd like our code to be able to make decisions.

The Python programs we've written so far have had one-track minds: they can add two numbers or `print` something, but they don't have the 
ability to pick one of these outcomes over the other.

__Control flow__ gives us this ability to choose among outcomes based on what else is happening in the program.
