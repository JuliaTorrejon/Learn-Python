## How the Tables Have Turned

Comparisons result in either True or False, which are booleans as we learned before.

```pyhton
# Make me true!
bool_one = 3 < 5
```

Let's switch it up: we'll give the boolean, and you'll write the expression, just like the example above.

## Code Example

Instructions  | 
------------  | 
For each boolean value in the editor, write an expression that evaluates to that value. Remember, comparators are: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=`.
Use at least three different ones!
Don't just use `True` and `False`! That's cheating!

```python
# Create comparative statements as appropriate on the lines below!

# Make me true!
bool_one = 3 < 5  # We already did this one for you!

# Make me false!
bool_two = 2 > 3

# Make me true!
bool_three = 5 >= 5

# Make me false!
bool_four = 2 != 2

# Make me true!
bool_five = 1 == 1
