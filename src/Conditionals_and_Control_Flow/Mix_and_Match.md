This time we'll give the expected result, and you'll use some combination of boolean operators to achieve that result.

Remember, the boolean operators are `and`, `or`, and `not`. Use each one at least once!

```python
# Use boolean expressions as appropriate on the lines below!

# Make me false!
bool_one = (2 <= 2) and "Alpha" == "Bravo"  # We did this one for you!

# Make me true!
bool_two = (10 / 5 == 2) or "Julia" == "Julia"

# Make me false!
bool_three = (100 <= 50) and not "Alpha" == "Alphie" 

# Make me true!
bool_four = (14 == 7 + 7) and "Car" == "Car"

# Make me true!
bool_five = (10 == 10) or "Lion" == "Lion"
```
