## Arithmetic

One thing computers are capable of doing exceptionally well is performing arithmetic. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and other numeric calculations are easy to do in most programming languages, and Python is no exception. Some examples:

``` python
mirthful_addition = 12381 + 91817
amazing_subtraction = 981 - 312
trippy_multiplication = 38 * 902
happy_division = 540 / 45
sassy_combinations = 129 * 1345 + 120 / 6 - 12
```

Above are a number of arithmetic operations, each assigned to a variable. The variable will hold the final result of each operation. Combinations of arithmetical operators follow the usual order of operations.

Python also offers a companion to division called the modulo operator. The modulo operator is indicated by `%` and returns the remainder after division is performed.

In the above code block, we use the modulo operator to find the remainder of `15` divided by `2`. Since `15` is an odd number the remainder is `1`.

We also check the remainder of `133 / 7`. Since `133` divided by `7` has no remainder, `133 % 7` evaluates to `0`.

## Code Example

------------  | 
Multiply two numbers together and assign the result to a variable called `product`. 
What is the remainder when `1398` is divided by `11`? Save the results in a variable called `remainder`.       |

```python
product = 2 * 2
remainder = 1398 % 11
```
