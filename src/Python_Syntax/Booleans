## Booleans
Sometimes we have a need for variables that are either true or false. This datatype, which can only ever take one of two values, 
is called a boolean. In Python, we define booleans using the keywords `True` and `False`:

```python
a = True
b = False
````

A boolean is actually a special case of an integer. A value of `True` corresponds to an integer value of `1`, and will behave the same. 
A value of `False corresponds to an integer value of 0.
