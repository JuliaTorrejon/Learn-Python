Programming is the act of teaching a computer to have a conversation with a user, <br/> But first of all we would need to teach the computer how to speak. In Python, <br/> this is accomplished with the print statement.

```python
print "Hello, world!"
print "Waterâ€”there is not a drop of water there!"

A print statement is the easiest way to get your Python programme to communicate with you. 
Being able to command this communication will be one of the most valuable tools in your programming toolbox.
