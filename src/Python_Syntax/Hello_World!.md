## Hello World!


Programming is the act of teaching a computer to have a conversation with a user, <br/> But first of all we would need to teach the computer how to speak. In Python, <br/> this is accomplished with the print statement.

```python
print "Hello, world!"
print "Waterâ€”there is not a drop of water there!"
```

A print statement is the easiest way to get Python programme to communicate with the user. <br/> Being able to command this communication will be one of the most valuable tools in the programming toolbox.
