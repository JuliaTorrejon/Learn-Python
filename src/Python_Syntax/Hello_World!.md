Programming is the act of teaching a computer to have a conversation with a user, 
But it would be needed to first teach the computer how to speak. 
In Python, this is accomplished with the print statement.

Exercise: 

```python
print "Hello, world!"
print "Waterâ€”there is not a drop of water there!"

A print statement is the easiest way to get your Python program to communicate with you. 
Being able to command this communication will be one of the most valuable tools in your programming toolbox.
