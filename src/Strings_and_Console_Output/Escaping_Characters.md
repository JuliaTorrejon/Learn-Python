## Escaping Characters

There are some characters that cause problems. For example:

``` python
'There's a snake in my boot!'
```

This code breaks because Python thinks the apostrophe in `'There's'` ends the string. 
We can use the backslash to fix the problem, like this:

``` python
'There\'s a snake in my boot!'
```
