## Explicit String Conversion

Sometimes you need to combine a string with something that isn't a string. 
In order to do that, you have to convert the non-string into a string.

``` python
print "I have " + str(2) + " coconuts!"
```

This will print `I have 2 coconuts!`.

The `str()` method converts non-strings into strings. In the above example, you convert the number `2` 
into a string and then you concatenate the strings together just like in the previous exercise.

Now try it yourself!

## Code Example

1.Use `str()` to turn `3.14` into a string. Then run the code again.

``` python
# Turn 3.14 into a string!
print "The value of pi is around " + str(3.14)
```
