## String Methods

Let's see how we can change them using __string methods__.

__String methods__ let you perform specific tasks for strings.

We'll focus on four string methods:

1. `len()`
2. `lower()`
3. `upper()`
4. `str()`

Let's start with len(), which gets the length (the number of characters) of a string!

## Code Example

Instructions  | 
------------  | 
1.On line 1, create a variable named `parrot` and set it to the string `"Norwegian Blue"`.
2.On line 2, type `len(parrot)` after the word `print`, like so: `print len(parrot)`. The output will be the number of characters in `"Norwegian Blue"!`

``` python
parrot = "Norwegian Blue"
print len(parrot)
```
