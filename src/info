/dist means "distribution", the compiled code/library.
Folder structure varies by build system and programming language. Here are some standard conventions:

src/: "source" files to build and develop the project. This is where the original source files are located, before being compiled into fewer files to dist/, public/ or build/.
dist/: "distribution", the compiled code/library, also named public/ or build/. The files meant for production or public use are usually located here.
lib/: external dependencies (when included directly).
test/: the project's tests scripts, mocks, etc.
vendor/: dependencies are usually put here via dependency management.
bin/: files that get added to your PATH when installed.

Markdown/Text Files:
README.md: A help file which addresses setup, tutorials, and documents the project. README.txt is also used.
LICENSE.md: any rights given to you regarding the project. LICENSE or LICENSE.txt are variations of the license file name, having the same contents.
CONTRIBUTING.md: how to help out with the project. Sometimes this is addressed in the README.md file.

Specific (these could go on forever):
package.json: describes library and dependencies (if a JS package).
composer.json: same as above but for PHP packages via composer.
.travis.yml: config file for the Travis CI environment.
.gitignore: Specification of the files meant to be ignored by Git.
